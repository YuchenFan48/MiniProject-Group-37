## Summary

Our program needs a GUI panel, so that users better operation, reduce the program's learning costs, first need a choice to identify video and image address function, to make it easier for users to find the video they need to identify, they need a“Start identifying” prompt button. When the button is pressed, it will start identifying the video, and then it will go dark, it will not light up again until the end of recognition, which means it can be recognized again
At the same time, we need to optimize the training model of YOLOV8 to make it more stable and less error, so as to avoid errors in the video box selection, identification problems
